# Rob the Bank!
A submission by a couple of high school students for the March 2019 Repl.it Game Jam.
We started working on it with the start of the Game Jam, on March 18th! The three of
us have had various amounts of coding experience, and we've been able to use our skills
in different areas to hopefully give you a really fun game.

Inspired by the theme of this year's Game Jam, cash, we decided to make an RPG game
based around robbing a bank. You are a high school student who owes a fellow
sufferer 10 whole cents, and since both of your parents think you need to start
earning your own money, you've decided to go rob a bank! But it's not as easy as you
had previously thought. After the first couple tries, you realize you'll need some
better infiltration skills than trying to pick a lock with a hairpin, and all the
while, interest is collecting. Best of luck!

Got any suggestions? Let us know in the comments below.

# How to Play
Use WASD or arrow keys to move. Press enter into interact with objects. You can use
objects to get your way into the bank, but once you do, be careful!

# Inspiration
Since us high schoolers are all avid gamers, a couple games we based ours off of are:
- Pokemon
- Escapists
- Undertale

We recommend you go and check them out as well!
